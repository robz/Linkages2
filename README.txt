This is a tool that makes it easy to quickly build fivebar linkages to trace out complex paths. The linkages available are actuated by two rotatary inputs running at constant rates.

Current features:
- Immediate calculation of traced paths 
- Tweaking any length/angle/ground position in realtime
- Automated optimization (rudimentary)
- Preventing invalid configurations
- Export of basic linkage spec

Planned features:
- Tweaking rotatary speeds (integer ratios between rotatary inputs)
- Importing/exporting full linkage spec
- Exposing optmization parameters for editing in the UI
- Drawing multiple paths before optmization
- "Random configuration" button

Wishlist:
- Improving optimization error functions/algorithm

To test the effectiveness of this tool, I will use it make a "linkage font" by creating a linkage for each letter of the alphabet.
