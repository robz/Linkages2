This is a tool that makes it easy to quickly build fivebar linkages to trace out complex paths. The linkages available are actuated by two rotatary inputs running at constant rates.

Current features:
- Immediate calculation and display of traced paths 
- Tweaking any linkage length/angle/ground point position/rotatry speed in realtime
- Automated optimization (rudimentary)
- Tweaking some optimization parameters
- Preventing invalid configurations
- Import/export full linkage spec

Planned features:
- Exposing NUM_POINTS, NUM_STEPS optmization parameters
- Allowing segment & smart segment optmization
- "Random configuration" button
- theta2phase control

Wishlist:
- Improving optimization error functions/algorithm
- Automatic random configurations built into optimization

To test the effectiveness of this tool, I will use it make a "linkage font" by creating a linkage to trace the shape of each letter of the alphabet.
